Hello!

To run this code, first clone the git repository.

Feel free to open up main.cpp and change line 32 to properly reflect which tables you want to see joined.

In the terminal, navigate to the folder where main.cpp is present.

Type make main; ./main 
or if that doesn't work type ./main

Finally, the output can be viewed in output.txt
